The value types in elixir represents numbers, names and regular expressions

integers
========
integer literals can be written as decimals(1234), hexadecimals(oxcafe),octal(0o765) and binary (0b1010)

decimal numbers may contain underscores - these are often used to separate groups of three digits when writting 
large numbers , so 1 million could be written as 1_000_000
there is no fixed limit on the size of integers - their internal representation grows to fit their magnitude

floating point numbers
=======================

floating point numbers are written as a decimal point.
there must be at least one digit before and after the decimal point.
