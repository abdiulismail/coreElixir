elixir types can hold values of any type(including other collections)

Tuples
=======
A tuple is an ordered collection of values.
As will all elixir data structures , once created a tuple cannot be modified
you write a tuple between braces, separating the elements with commas

--code-------
 { 1,2 }
 --end code---

a typical elixir tuple had two to four elements - any more and you will probably want to look at maps or structs

you can use tuples in pattern matching

----code-------
iex(5)> {status, count, action } = {:ok,43,"next"}
{:ok, 43, "next"}
iex(6)> 
---end code----------

“t is common for functions to return a tuple where the first element
is the atom :ok if there were no errors.”

“​iex>​ {status, file} = File.open(​"​​mix.exs"​)​ 
{:ok, #PID<0.39.0>}”

“Because the file was successfully opened, the tuple contains an :ok
status and a PID, which is how we access the contents.”
